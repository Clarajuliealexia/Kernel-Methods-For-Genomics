iPython Notebook providing our solution to the Data Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/kernel-methods-for-machine-learning-2018-2019 
proposed as part of the Kernel Methods course (MVA MSc). Classification task: predicting whether a DNA sequence region is binding site
to a specific transcription factor.Transcription factors (TFs) are regulatory proteins that bind specific sequence motifs in the genome
to activate or repress transcription of target genes. Genome-wide protein-DNA binding maps can be profiled using some experimental techniques
and thus all genomics can be classified into two classes for a TF of interest: bound or unbound. In this challenge, we will work with three
datasets corresponding to three different TFs.

**Most important rule** : the use of external machine learning libraries is forbidden (libsvm, liblinear, scikit-learn, ...)
